# MCS Data Cleaner
## What it is
Script that cleans/sanitize MCS extracted data to use it for PowerBI reports. Based on what I've learned from python persistence and csv.
## How it works
Take a raw .tsv with all summarized results from a range of time and organize the data in Speed and VoIP values. Afterwards it adds some useful columns to each of them that will be used later on for PBI Reports.
